    <h2>PNG</h2>
    <p>Good for diagrams and icons. For photos, a PNG file of the same quality would generally be bigger than an equivalent JPG
    file. However, they do deal with opacity just fine, and they don’t have color palette limitations.</p>

    <h2>Attribute in html</h2>
    <p>An HTML attribute gives additional information to an HTML element and always goes in the element’s opening tag. An
    attribute is usually made up of two parts: a name, and a value; however, not all attributes require a value. In our
    case, we need to add an href (hypertext reference) attribute to the opening anchor tag.</p>
